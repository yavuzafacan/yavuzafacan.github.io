* What a Game!

Ok you might think this is about the Jays but you're mistaken. This is much more important than that. It's our semi-weekly football(not soccer) game.

I don't even know how this game came about this week because we were just 5 people the day before and managed to bring together 15! I'm going to go ahead and give a big portion of the credit to myself, but in truth everyone helped it come together. Game was electric, and teams were pretty even considering we hadn't played with most of the players there.

I think the fact that it felt like everyone had fun made me happier than the way everyone played. But oh boy, I just want to tell you about this free kick; this fast, smart player on my team with a man united ronaldo shirt on was runnning it up all game.

World Series game 7 is tonight baby! Go Jays!
