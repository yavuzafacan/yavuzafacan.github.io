To write this at 4:26am on a Saturday shows a lot about my current habits. I feel my eyes pushing through the struggle of staying open as my fingers fly across the keyboard. My torso is straight, while my knees are bent to support the laptop that delicately balances between my stomach and thighs.
</p>

<p>
It's been a long September, and now I feel calmness wash over me as a month of school is left behind and an eager set of midterms awaits on the other side of this reading week. It's always the same story; you say you'll study this time, that you have to catch up on lectures but nevertheless it's Thursday, and you barely did any work so you cram away until Sunday and feel the anxiety that unpreparedness brings freeze you. What's different this time? I don't want to lie and persuade both you and me that I'm a changed man and have reformed since my past actions. However, reminding you of the time being this late, would suggest otherwise. Promises were not kept. I still struggle to keep up with lectures after missing one, because I feel behind and don't want to go to a lecture that I know I wouldn't understand, even though not going makes it worse and now it's 2 been lectures and that snowballs into an entire semester of lectures left unattended; gone in the blink of an eye.
</p>

<p>
I feel a call to action and a desire to change when I reflect on previous actions as they happen but that emotion fades away as time goes by and then I can't feel the urge to push through and get my shit together. I fear this is becoming a reoccuring theme which grows into a bigger task to overcome and a stronger habit to break. I feel like I know the right path forward and the right things to do but it's so difficult to do them when it's much easier to scroll away and forget about the task or perform easier non-critical tasks.
</p>

<p>
I don't know what's different this time. But I know something has to change.
