* People I Find Inspiring

2025-09-30

This feels personal in a way, so I thought it would be a good way for you to get to know me. This is from all over and in no particular order. I wouldn't say I follow them daily, but I do like to check up on what they've got going on once in a while. There are others, friends, but I don't know if I'm ready to share them on the internet yet.
